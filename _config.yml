  Hi, my name is Will and I am an experienced senior software engineer, engineering leader, and an all around curious person. I have a demonstrated history of helping software teams shorten feedback loops, ship software, and stay happy. I can own critical business systems and lead strategic planning, roadmapping, and team planning. I believe small, empowered teams make employees happy and quality software products that delight users follows as a result.

          Something old made new again
        description: | 
          When my parents moved out of their house, they wanted to re-home [a radio from my great-grandparent's generation](https://www.radiomuseum.org/r/belmont_582_ch_series_b.html){:target="_blank"}. For a time before TVs, this radio was the centerpiece of family entertainment. However, time hadn't been kind; the power cord was fraying and the tuner didn't work. My step daughter decided to open it up and get it working again. We removed the guts, reattached the tuner and soon had a functional, but impractical AM-only radio. We decided to honor the legacy of the radio as a centerpiece by refurbishing the case, updating the inside to support Bluetooth connections and FM bandwidths using the Arduino prototyping platform, and adding a bit of visual amusement with some ferrofluid. 
          
          This project taught me a lot about hardware components including Serial Peripheral Interfaces (SPI), Bluetooth protocols, power supplies and voltages. I also practiced my skills at case making and mounting components in a way that is durable enough to withstand human interactions. All along the way passing as much of my knowledge and learnings on to my ten year old step daughter as we worked together.

          How can I plan for staffing changes on modern software teams?
        description: | 
          At Pivotal Labs, we had an in-house tool specifically for the frequent cross team rotation we valued in our practice. Since leaving Pivotal, I longed to have that tool to plan for changes in the teams I was leading. In 2022 I set out to solve that problem, and built an application called Reteamer. I designed it using the organizational principles described in Heidi Helfand's book, [_Dynamic Reteaming_](https://www.heidihelfand.com/dynamic-reteaming/){:target="_blank"}. I also built a new database ORM for Rails called (furcate)[https://github.com/TildeWill/furcate]{:target="_blank"} which added the ability to "fork" a set of data in a database, treating it much like a git repo for collaboration.
          
          Through this project, I learned a lot about data structure and storage, event logging, and bitemporal data modeling. It was also a great chance for me to spin up my third business - I have previously started a sport fencing club and a company around the (Hugin automation project](https://github.com/huginn/huginn){:target="_blank"}. Ultimately, Reteamer was shelved after gathering customer feedback on the prototype. People allocations touches many other systems including identity, payroll, billing and financial forecasting, time cards, and more. Building those integrations was beyond the scope of what the company could do with a handful of employees.

          Starting from zero with a growth mindset
        description: |
          I have a somewhat absurd dream of having a keyboard-like input device incorporated in to my pants so I can sit down and interact with any device in front of me from a desktop to a phone or streaming service on a TV that necessitates I type out my email address and password using arrow keys only. More practically, I wanted to improve my soldering skills and I knew from the radio project that I had a lot of room to grow there.  
          
          I came across the ChocV keyboard an fell in love with the low profile, compact size, ortholinear key layout, and simple design. It is a 36-key keyboard and instead of the traditional QWERTY layout uses a layout called [Miryoku by Manna Harbour](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku){:target="_blank"}. It also incorporates six "layers" (think of a layer like your shift key which gives you a whole new set of characters), and through all this it keeps my fingers on the home row more than I could have ever imagined. Even with the well documented repo of the ChocV I still needed to learn a lot about mechanical keyboards, and for that I turned to an old colleague who was known for having a custom mechanical keyboard or "keeb" as they're often called. Through him I learned about the switches - clicky, tactile, linear, silent - and keycaps of which there are a lot, membranes, firmware frameworks, vendors that might be able to sell me what I need, and forums where I might find more help. I got a lot of help from the ChocV creator too when it came time to flash the firmware and debug my work. I ended up writing about how [this project really took a community to bootstrap my knowledge](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/willread_i-built-a-keyboard-but-that-is-a-lie-when-activity-7120579022039719936-q5lh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop){:target="_blank"}.  
          
          In the end I have a functioning keyboard that's pretty easy to travel with. I not only upped my solder game but I also learned how to use solder paste to connect surface mount devices (SMD). While this rigid, unibody keyboard won't address my dreams of keyboard pants, I do plan to take the next step and build a [Stront](https://github.com/zzeneg/stront){:target="_blank"} which will teach me about split keyboards and will incorporate extra inputs like a track pad and scroll wheels. After that, maybe it'll be flexible PCBs, [incorporating magnets](https://evantravers.com/articles/2023/04/06/magsafe-tenting-and-wearable-keyboards/){:target="_blank"}, or looking into e-textile techniques to sew soft switches into my leg wear.

            I've been freelancing for a few years now and worked with some outstanding people at companies that are working on growth goals like VoteAmerica gearing up for the 2022 election, looking to be purchased like Aperture, or finding their way after a number of acquisitions like Schlesinger. In any situation I use my ability as a leader to get all the ideas out on the table, not just my own, so we can have the best possible outcome. My goal is to honor the idealogy of Robert Baden-Powell to "Leave this world a little better than you found it." so that when my contract is up I know I had a positive impact. 
          
            However, while I am pretty good at building software and leading software organizations, I am not as energized by taxes, and marketing myself, and all the other things that come from running a small business. New freelance gigs are always nice, but I am now shifting gears to find full time employment so that spend more of my time in ways that bring me energy and excitement.

          Before Sustainable Magic and a year long adventure at Stitch Fix, I spent about ten years working at Pivotal Labs. This experience is a cornerstone of my career and has shaped how I approach people and problems. Before coming to Pivotal, I had worked in a small startup that practiced Scrum, but we still did a lot of design up front and we didn't collaborate any more than we had to. At Pivotal, we paired as close to 100% of the time as we could. I loved going to work because I always felt supported, never stuck, never singled out. If you didn't have the skill needed, chances are you pair did, or you could quickly find someone who did. There was no shame; learning was truly at the forefront.
          
          Throughout my time I worked with over twenty different companies. Some we small startups and the entire company sat next to us in our office. Some were massive Fortune 100 companies and we traveled to sit with just a small slice of their software product workforce. I got to try many things in many environments and lear what did and didn't work. As my toolbox grew, so did my responsibilities. I became a manager, responsible for ten to fifteen other people who usually weren't working on the same thing as me. I had to get good at gathering feedback, and developed tools that told me when to trust what I heard and when to ask more questions. At the end of my time at Pivotal I got to apply all this learning as one of our first Agile Leadership Coaches. In this role I got to work with department leaders, not only helping them create highly productive and efficient teams, but also help them upskill at leadership and running a team of teams who needed authority to match their responsibility. 
          
          As I grew, so did Pivotal Labs. We were acquired by Dell, then spun out into a public company via an IPO, then taken acquired by VMWare just after I left. Pivotal has since been rebranded and now VMWare has been acquired by Broadcom, so the company I knew is all but gone. However, there is an alumni Slack that keeps a lot of the same spirit and continues to be a community I rely heavily on when I need a safe place to discuss ideas and challenges.

          It was here at Purdue that I learned to fence. I got to put my programming skills to use as the club's webmaster, building tools to keep track of membership and tournament registrations. My sophomore year I was elected Vice President of the one hundred member club, and then served as President for two years after that. This was a leadership opportunity unlike any I had held up to that point and I am forever grateful for the lessons it taught me along the way.

      Alongside my interests in leading people and software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Rock climbing - This is how I trick my brain into being okay with exercise
      - Board Gaming (Wingspan, Catan, Heat, Power Grid) and Escape Rooms - My thinking is that puzzles keep the mind young
      - Homesteading, Off grid living, and Earth Ships - someday I want to build a sustainable home that is self reliant
      - Backpacking - Being in nature and away from creature comforts is one of the main ways I stay appreciative of life
      - Home repair - I love fixing people's homes including drywall, small electrical work, and plumbing, just ask!
